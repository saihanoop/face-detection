# face-detection
simple face detection model generated using convolutional neural network.
This model can detect only three faces which includes 2 of my friends' and mine.
the model has secured 73.8% accuracy and can successfully differentiate between us.

As training data x.pickle and trained model faces_2.model are big i,m unable to upload them. but you can find them in below link:

As I have already trined the model you can run final.py to start detection.
If you want you can train again using train using triainmodel.py
